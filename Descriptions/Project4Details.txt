Implemented type checking for the image-processing language as specified in the attached document 'TypeRulesV2.pdf'. 
That is, implemented the ASTVisitor interface.

When an error is discovered, the node currently being checked (i.e. if an error is detected in method visitX, the current X node is added to the error NodeList), and a useful error message are appended to the errorLog. 

Assuming that prog is an AST of a correct program from the Parser, the following code fragment would result in type checking.

TypeCheckVisitor v = new TypeCheckVisitor();
prog.visit(v, null);
if (!v.isCorrect()) {
	System.out.println(v.getLog());
	//we’re done with this program, exit or do something else sensible
}
else //program is correct
	go on to code gen (in Projects 5 and 6)
